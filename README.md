# MIS445-Portfolio-Project
This project was completed as part of a Data Analytics course I took at CSU Global. Logistic Regression is one my favorite analytics models to process, partly because it is one that I understand the most. For this project we were asked to examine 34 variables in the a data file for a telecommunications company and develop a research report using SAS.
